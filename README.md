A movie theater seat reservation application.

## About

In this app you can choose the movie, the session and the seats you want to do a reservation. All data are stored in a public API.

I created this project with the aim of simulating a real movie theater seat reservation environment with good interactivity and responsiveness in addition to challenging myself.
